    <h2>About beer</h2>
            <p>Beer is one of the oldest alcoholic drinks in the world,[1][2][3] the most widely consumed,[4] and the third most popular drink after water and tea.
            </p>
            <p>Beer is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. The fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the beer.
